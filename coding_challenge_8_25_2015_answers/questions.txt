6.  contains
Returns true if the value is present in the list

7.  shuffle
Returns a shuffled copy of the list

8.  reject
Returns the values in list without the elements that the truth test passes, opposite of filter

9.  filter
Returns the values of a list that pass a truth test

10.  intersection
produce an array that contains every item shared between all of the passed in arrays
